# Rails administration dashboard example

A roll-your-own alternative to admin gems for Rails applications, using RSpec request specs for some basic BDD goodness.

The source is best viewed successively by branch:

* the `dashboard` branch shows how to make a basic, namespaced administration dashboard (see http://everydayrails.com/2012/07/31/rails-admin-panel-from-scratch.html)
* the `scaffold` branch builds off of `dashboard`, taking source that was generated by a Rails scaffold and moving it into the `admin` namespace (see http://everydayrails.com/2012/08/07/rails-admin-panel-from-scratch-2.html)
* the `resource` branch shows how to add non-scaffolded code directly to the namespace to manage an ActiveRecord resource (see http://everydayrails.com/2012/08/19/rails-admin-panel-from-scratch-3.html)
* `master` contains the completed project (basically the same as `resource` except this `README`)
